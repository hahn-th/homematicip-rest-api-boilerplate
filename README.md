# Boilerplate for HomematicIP-Rest-API

This is a boilerplate which demonstrates how to get informed for changes in HomematicIP Cloud instead of polling every X minutes and get throttled. This is a starter package for the library https://github.com/hahn-th/homematicip-rest-api 

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements.

To start the example execute client.py: `python.exe src/client.py`

I recommend, to use a virtualenv.

PullRequests, which creates a better starter-package feeling are welcome.
